# Part 7 – Putting It All Together (Final Class)

## Goals
- Merge features into a cohesive `FileTransferServer`.
- Provide a clean constructor with sensible defaults.
- Document public methods and calling conventions.

## What You’ll Build
- Final class with:
  - Configurable `file_path`, `save_dir`, `direction` (download/upload/both).
  - `limit`, `encoded` mode, randomized `route`, `port`.
  - Optional HTML landing page.
  - `on_transfer` callback, `start()`/`stop()`, `__repr__`.
  - Logging wired throughout.

## Sections
- **Constructor Design:** Parameters, defaults, trade-offs.
- **Route Wiring:** Conditional registration by `direction`.
- **Lifecycle:** Start thread, shutdown watcher, admin endpoint.
- **Error Semantics:** 400/404/410; when and why.
- **Security/Hygiene:** Bind addresses, exposure window, directory traversal, input sizes.
- **Operational Recipes:** Common patterns (single delivery server; exfil sink; upload receiver).
- **Milestone:** End-to-end test: start → transfer → auto-shutdown → review logs/artifacts.

## Exercises
- Run with `direction=both` and exercise all endpoints.
- Swap random route length; verify it in logs and via curl.
- Integrate into a PoC skeleton and document the exact steps.
